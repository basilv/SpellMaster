/**
 * SpellMaster Plugin for CanaryMod Server
 *
 * Players can obtain spellbooks by performing ceremonies and then cast the corresponding spells
 * Spells are designed to introduce more variety to the game and/or reduce the tedium (e.g. mining), but spells are balanced 
 * by having a variety of costs (e.g. consume inventory slots for spellbooks and spell components, cost health, or cost materials)
 * The power of spells generally increases with the player's level, introducing yet another tradeoff between having more powerful spells
 * and enchanting / repairing via the enchantment table or anvil.
 * The learning of spells is designed to be difficult enough to not make the very early game any easier: for example, the spell to help with mining
 * cannot be learned until the player has already done some amount of mining.
